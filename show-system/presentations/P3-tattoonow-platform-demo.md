Portfolio management is dead simple: drag and drop photos, we automatically
optimize them for fast loading, and you can tag each piece by style, placement,

**Client View:**
- Clients see only available slots
- Book directly into your calendar
- Automatic confirmation emails
- Reminders sent 24 hours before

**Presenter Script:**
```
Your availability calendar syncs everything.

You set your working hours, block out time for existing appointments, add buffer
time between sessions, and mark vacation days.

Clients see only your available slots—they can't double-book you or request times
you're not working.

When they book, it goes straight into your calendar, they get an automatic
confirmation, and a reminder 24 hours before.

No more back-and-forth "Are you free Tuesday at 2pm?" messages. They see availability,
they book, done.
```

**Presenter Script:**
```
Let's look at consultation requests—this is where new clients enter your pipeline.

When someone wants to book with you, they fill out a consultation request form.
You get all the details: what they want, where, how big, budget, and reference photos.

You review it and send a custom quote. You can propose available dates, request
a deposit, or ask follow-up questions.

If they approve, they book directly. If they don't respond, we send an automated
reminder after 3 days.

Every interaction is tracked so you can see your conversion rate and optimize
your booking process.

**Presenter Script:**
```
Every client gets a profile in your database.

You can see their entire history with you: every session, every piece, total hours,
total spend.

Add notes: "Great pain tolerance, books far in advance, always tips well."

Tag clients: VIP, repeat customer, came from Instagram, whatever helps you
track relationships.

This isn't just record-keeping—it's relationship building. When a client books
their third session, you can reference their previous work and preferences.

That's the kind of personal touch that builds loyalty.

Send the invoice via email or text—client pays with a card, Apple Pay, whatever
they prefer.

Deposits are collected online when they book. It auto-deducts from the final
invoice, so you're not doing math.

And here's something artists love: digital tips. Clients can add a tip at checkout,
and you keep 100%—we don't take a cut of tips.

Faster payments, less awkwardness, more money in your pocket.

Now the analytics—this is where you level up your business game.

See your revenue broken down by day, week, month. Track your average session value.

Monitor your booking conversion rate: out of 100 consultation requests, how many
actually book? If it's low, maybe your pricing is unclear or your response time
is too slow.

See where clients are finding you. Is Instagram your #1 source? Google? Referrals?
Double down on what's working.

Track your hours worked, average session length, busiest times. Use this data to
optimize your schedule and pricing.

Most artists run their business on gut feeling. You'll run yours on data.

click, rate you, leave a testimonial. It takes 30 seconds.

Those reviews show up on your public profile with a verified client badge—so
people know they're real.

You can respond to reviews, share the best ones on social media, or print them
