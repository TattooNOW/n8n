**Host Script:**
```
Welcome back to the TattooNOW Weekly Show! Today we're flipping the script—
instead of talking TO artists, we're talking FOR clients.

If you're planning your next tattoo, or maybe your first one, the single most
important decision you'll make isn't the design, it's not the placement—
it's choosing the RIGHT artist.

I'm joined by Sarah Miller, who has over 40 hours of tattoo work from 15 different
artists across the country. Sarah's become an expert at finding the perfect match
for each piece. Sarah, welcome!

[Sarah responds]

Today we're breaking down the exact system Sarah uses to research, vet, and book
with artists. Let's get into it.

**TattooNOW Platform**
"Find your perfect artist in minutes, not months"

## 🔍 SEGMENT 1: Know Your Style (3:30 - 12:00)

### Slide 2: Tattoo Style Guide

**Visual:**
- 8-panel grid showing different tattoo styles
- High-quality example of each style
- Style name overlaid on each panel

**The Major Styles:**
1. **Traditional** - Bold lines, limited color palette
2. **Realism** - Photographic detail, portraits
3. **Black & Grey** - Shading masters, no color
4. **Watercolor** - Painterly, flowing colors
5. **Geometric** - Precise lines, sacred geometry
6. **Japanese** - Traditional irezumi, cultural motifs
7. **Neo-Traditional** - Modern take on classic style
8. **Minimalist** - Fine lines, simple designs

**Speaker Notes:**
```
First step: know what style you want. And I mean REALLY know.

Sarah, walk us through the major tattoo styles.

[Sarah discusses each style]

This is critical because artists specialize. A realism artist might not be great
at traditional. A watercolor specialist might struggle with geometric precision.

You wouldn't hire a portrait painter to do abstract art, right? Same logic here.
```

### Slide 3: Style Matching Quiz

**Visual:**
- Interactive quiz format
- 5 questions with visual examples
- Results showing recommended styles

**Find Your Style:**

**Question 1: What art do you love?**
- Vintage posters → Traditional
- Photography → Realism
- Paintings → Watercolor
- Architecture → Geometric

**Question 2: Color or Black & Grey?**
- Bold colors → Traditional/Neo-Traditional
- Subtle colors → Watercolor
- No color → Black & Grey/Geometric

**Question 3: Detail level?**
- Photographic → Realism
- Bold & simple → Traditional
- Minimal → Minimalist
- Intricate → Japanese/Geometric

**On-Screen Text:**
> "Your style preference = Your artist search filter"

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Here's a quick exercise: answer these questions and you'll narrow down your style.

What art do you naturally gravitate toward? Photography? Vintage posters? Modern
minimalism? That's your clue.

Do you want color or black and grey? How much detail appeals to you?

Once you know your style, finding the right artist becomes 10x easier.

Sarah, how did you figure out your style preferences?

### Slide 4: Red Flags vs. Green Flags

**Visual:**
- Split screen: Left (red flags) vs. Right (green flags)
- Check marks and X marks
- Artist portfolio examples

**🚩 RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ Inconsistent quality across portfolio
- ❌ Can do "any style" (jack of all trades, master of none)
- ❌ Mostly old work (not current skills)
- ❌ No healed photos (only fresh tattoos)
- ❌ Defensive about questions
- ❌ No clear booking process
- ❌ Extremely cheap pricing

**✅ GREEN FLAGS:**
- ✓ Consistent style and quality
- ✓ Specialty clearly defined
- ✓ Mix of fresh AND healed work
- ✓ Active social media with recent work
- ✓ Professional communication
- ✓ Transparent pricing
- ✓ Consultation process

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Now let's talk red flags versus green flags when researching artists.

RED FLAGS:
- If their portfolio shows wildly inconsistent quality, that's a red flag
- If they claim they can do ANY style perfectly, be skeptical
- If all their photos are brand new work with no healed examples—you can't see
  how their tattoos age
- If they get defensive when you ask questions—run

GREEN FLAGS:
- Consistent, high-quality work in their specialty
- Portfolio shows both fresh AND healed tattoos
- They're active on social media posting recent work
- Professional communication
- Clear pricing and booking process

Sarah, what were the biggest green flags you looked for?

[Sarah discusses her criteria]

Exactly. Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is.

### Slide 5: The Research Checklist

**Visual:**
- Clipboard with checklist
- Browser tabs showing different research sources
- Magnifying glass over artist profiles

**Your 30-Minute Research Process:**

**✓ Step 1: Social Media Audit (10 min)**
- Instagram portfolio review
- Read ALL comments on recent posts
- Check how they respond to DMs
- Look at tagged photos from clients

**✓ Step 2: Website Deep Dive (5 min)**
- Portfolio organization
- About page (training, experience)
- Booking process clarity
- Pricing transparency

**✓ Step 3: Reviews & Testimonials (10 min)**
- Google reviews
- Yelp (if applicable)
- Reddit mentions (r/tattoos, local subreddits)
- Facebook recommendations

**✓ Step 4: Studio Visit (5 min research)**
- Studio photos/videos
- Cleanliness standards
- Location safety/accessibility
- Shop vibe

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Alright, you know your style. Now: how do you actually research artists?

Here's Sarah's 30-minute research process:

Start with Instagram. Look at their recent work—are they posting consistently?
Read the comments. How do they interact with clients? Are people tagging them
in healed photos?

Then check their website. Is it professional? Can you easily find pricing and
booking info?

Then go to Google and Yelp. Read reviews. Look for patterns—not just one-star
rants, but what do the GOOD reviews say? Do they mention cleanliness, professionalism,
communication?

Finally, look at the studio itself. Google the shop, look at photos. Does it look
clean and professional?

Sarah, walk us through your research process for your last tattoo.

[Sarah shares specific example]

### Slide 6: Instagram Investigation

**Visual:**
- Instagram profile mockup
- Highlighted sections: bio, highlights, tagged photos
- Comment section examples

**What to Look For:**

**Profile Bio:**
- Style specialty clearly stated?
- Booking info or link?
- Location mentioned?

**Content Quality:**
- Posting frequency (active vs. inactive)
- Photo quality (lighting, angles)
- Fresh vs. healed tattoos ratio
- Client diversity (different skin tones, body types)

**Engagement:**
- How they respond to questions
- Comments from past clients
- Tagged photos (real clients showing healed work)

**Red Flag Example:**
> Artist posts daily but hasn't shown a healed tattoo in 6 months

**Green Flag Example:**
> Artist posts mix of fresh/healed, responds professionally to all DMs within 24 hours

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Instagram is the #1 research tool for tattoos. But you need to know what to look for.

Check their bio—do they clearly state their specialty? Or is it vague?

Look at posting frequency. If they haven't posted in 3 months, they might not be
taking clients.

Most importantly: look at the RATIO of fresh to healed photos. Fresh tattoos always
look perfect. Healed tattoos show the artist's true skill. If an artist only posts
fresh work, that's a yellow flag.

And check tagged photos—real clients posting their healed work. That's the truth serum.

Sarah, how much weight do you put on Instagram versus other platforms?

[Sarah discusses social media importance]

### Slide 7: The Consultation

**Visual:**
- Consultation scene illustration
- Question checklist
- Artist sketching with client

**Questions to Ask in Your Consultation:**

**Technical Questions:**
1. "How many [style] tattoos have you done?"
2. "Can I see healed examples of your work?"
3. "What's your process from consultation to completion?"
4. "How do you handle touch-ups?"
5. "What aftercare do you recommend?"

**Logistics Questions:**
1. "What's your deposit policy?"
2. "How long is the waitlist?"
3. "Do you do multi-session pieces?"
4. "What's your hourly rate or project quote?"

**Vibe Check:**
- Do they listen to your ideas?
- Do they offer creative input?
- Are they patient with questions?
- Do you feel comfortable with them?

**On-Screen Text:**
> "A good artist welcomes questions.
> A great artist asks them too."

**Speaker Notes:**
```
You've done your research. Now: the consultation. This is where you'll know if
they're the right fit.

Come prepared with questions:
- How many tattoos in this style have you done?
- Can I see healed examples?
- What's your process?
- Touch-up policy?
- Aftercare recommendations?

Ask about logistics: deposit, wait times, pricing structure.

But here's the most important part: VIBE CHECK. Do they listen? Do they ask YOU
questions about your vision? Are they patient when you ask newbie questions?

A good artist welcomes questions. A great artist asks them right back—about your
pain tolerance, your lifestyle, your expectations.

Sarah, what questions revealed the most about an artist?

[Sarah discusses consultation insights]

If you leave a consultation feeling heard and excited—book it. If you feel rushed
or dismissed—keep looking.

## 💰 SEGMENT 3: Pricing & Booking (23:00 - 32:00)

### Slide 8: Understanding Pricing

**Visual:**
- Pricing breakdown chart
- Artist experience level comparison
- Cost vs. value scales

**Pricing Factors:**

**Artist Experience:**
- Apprentice: $50-$100/hr
- Mid-level (3-7 years): $100-$200/hr
- Established (7-15 years): $150-$300/hr
- Master/Celebrity: $300-$500+/hr

**Other Factors:**
- Location (NYC vs. small town)
- Complexity (simple vs. intricate)
- Size (hours required)
- Color vs. Black & Grey
- Demand (popular artists charge more)

**Minimum Charges:**
- Most artists: $100-$200 minimum
- Covers setup, small pieces, time

**On-Screen Text:**
> "Cheap tattoos aren't good.
> Good tattoos aren't cheap."

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Let's talk money. What should you expect to pay for a quality tattoo?

This varies wildly based on:
- Artist experience
- Location
- Complexity
- Size

A mid-level artist in most cities charges $150-$200 per hour. A small piece might
take 1-2 hours. A sleeve might take 15-30 hours over multiple sessions.

Most artists have a shop minimum—usually $100-$200—even for tiny tattoos. This
covers their setup time and supplies.

Here's the golden rule: cheap tattoos aren't good, and good tattoos aren't cheap.

If someone's charging $50/hour, ask yourself why. Are they building a portfolio?
Are they cutting corners on quality?

Sarah, how did you approach budgeting for your collection?

[Sarah discusses pricing philosophy]

You're wearing this for life. Invest accordingly.

### Slide 9: Deposits & Scheduling

**Visual:**
- Calendar with booking timeline
- Deposit payment example
- Cancellation policy graphic

**The Booking Process:**

**Step 1: Consultation**
- In-person or virtual
- Discuss design, placement, sizing
- Get quote and timeline

**Step 2: Design Approval**
- Artist creates custom design
- You review and request changes
- Final approval before appointment

**Step 3: Deposit**
- Typically $100-$200 or 50% of total
- Holds your appointment
- Often non-refundable

**Step 4: Appointment**
- Arrive on time, well-rested
- Bring ID and payment
- Follow pre-tattoo instructions

**Typical Timelines:**
- Popular artists: 3-12 month wait
- Mid-level artists: 1-3 month wait
- Newer artists: 1-4 weeks

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Once you've chosen your artist, here's what to expect:

You'll have a consultation—either in person or virtual. You'll discuss your idea,
placement, sizing. They'll give you a quote and timeline.

Then they'll create a custom design. You'll review it, request tweaks, approve it.

Next: deposit. Most artists require $100-$200 or 50% of the total cost to hold
your spot. This is usually non-refundable if you cancel.

Then you wait. Popular artists might have a 3-12 month waitlist. Mid-level artists
might be 1-3 months out.

On the day of your appointment: show up on time, well-rested, hydrated. Bring
your ID and payment. Follow any pre-tattoo instructions they gave you.

Sarah, what surprised you most about the booking process when you started?

[Sarah shares booking insights]

Patience pays off. Don't rush this.

### Slide 10: Booking Mistakes to Avoid

**Visual:**
- Mistake scenarios illustrated
- Wrong way vs. right way comparisons
- Warning signs

**Common Mistakes:**

**❌ MISTAKE #1: Price Shopping**
- Asking 20 artists "how much for a sleeve?"
- Going with the cheapest quote
- FIX: Choose based on portfolio fit, not price

**❌ MISTAKE #2: Pinterest Copying**
- Bringing a Pinterest tattoo: "I want exactly this"
- Every artist does their own interpretation
- FIX: Bring inspiration, not replication demands

**❌ MISTAKE #3: Rushing the Process**
- Booking the first available artist
- Getting tattooed while drunk/impaired
- FIX: Research, wait for the right artist

**❌ MISTAKE #4: Ignoring Red Flags**
- "They seemed sketchy but the price was good"
- Ignoring dirty studios or rude behavior
- FIX: Trust your instincts, walk away

**❌ MISTAKE #5: No Backup Plan**
- Putting all hope in one artist
- Not researching alternatives
- FIX: Have 2-3 artist options

**Speaker Notes:**
```
Before we wrap up, let's cover the biggest mistakes people make when booking:

MISTAKE #1: Price shopping. Messaging 20 artists asking "how much for a sleeve?"
and going with the cheapest. This is a recipe for regret. Choose based on portfolio
fit, not price.

MISTAKE #2: Pinterest copying. Bringing a Pinterest screenshot and saying "I want
EXACTLY this." That design was created for someone else. Bring inspiration, but
let your artist create something original for YOU.

MISTAKE #3: Rushing. Booking the first available artist because you want it NOW.
Bad idea. Wait for the right artist.

MISTAKE #4: Ignoring red flags. "The studio looked dirty but the price was good."
No. Walk away.

MISTAKE #5: No backup plan. Putting all your hopes on one artist, then being
devastated if they're booked for a year. Have 2-3 artists you'd be happy with.

Sarah, what's the biggest mistake you made early on?

[Sarah shares a personal mistake]

We all make mistakes. Learn from others' and save yourself the regret.
