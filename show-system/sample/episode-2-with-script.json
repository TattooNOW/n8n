React genuinely. If he mentions a specific turning point, dig deeper: 'What changed after that?' Keep energy conversational but focused. Goal: Help viewers see that underpricing hurts THEM and their CLIENTS (clients value what they pay for).",

Let him explain his deposit system (likely 50% upfront). Emphasize that deposits are STANDARD in professional services (lawyers, contractors, etc.). Pause after each strategy to let it sink in. If you need to fill time, ask: 'What's the biggest pricing mistake you see artists making?' Clock check: You should be at ~20 minutes elapsed by end of this segment.",

THIS is the gold content viewers will remember. After his response, add: 'Notice he didn't apologize or justify - he explained VALUE.' Emphasize that price objections are often VALUE objections in disguise. Ask: 'How do you qualify clients before discussing price?' Final 5 minutes: Open it up for any final pricing advice.

Action plan (speak directly to camera): (1) Write down your current rates, (2) Compare to your skill level and demand, (3) If you're undercharging, commit to raising prices by 20% for new clients starting next month.
