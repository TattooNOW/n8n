  "INTRO_SCRIPT": "Mike, thanks so much for being our first guest!\n\n[Mike responds]\n\nFor those who might not know your work, you've been tattooing for over 25 years, you're known worldwide for your photorealistic portraits and biomechanical pieces, and you run MD Tattoo Studio in Northridge, California. You've also won just about every award there is to win in this industry.\n\nBut today, we're not just talking about your art—we're talking about your business, specifically your website, which has become a major client acquisition tool for you. Let's start with a question: when did you realize that your website was actually losing you clients?",

  "SEGMENT_1_TITLE": "The Website Reality Check",
  "SEGMENT_1_SLIDES": "1, 5, 7, 9",
  "SEGMENT_1_POINTS": [
    "Most tattoo artists treat their website as an afterthought or digital business card",
    "Your website is your 24/7 salesperson working even when you're not",
    "First impressions happen in 7 seconds—if your site doesn't grab them immediately, they're gone",
    "Common mistakes: outdated designs, slow loading times, unclear booking process, no mobile optimization"
  ],
  "SEGMENT_1_SCRIPT": "Let's talk about the harsh reality: most tattoo artists have terrible websites. And I don't mean that to be mean—I've been there too. But the truth is, your website might be actively costing you clients right now without you even knowing it.\n\nMike, you've mentioned before that you used to have a pretty basic website. What changed?\n\n[Mike discusses his website evolution]\n\nExactly. And this is so important for everyone listening. Your website isn't just a place to show off your portfolio. It's your primary client acquisition and conversion tool. Let's go through the most common mistakes...\n\n[Walks through Slide 5: Common Website Mistakes]\n\n1. No clear call-to-action\n2. Portfolio without context\n3. No pricing information (even a range helps)\n4. Terrible mobile experience\n5. No social proof or testimonials\n6. Complicated or missing booking system\n\nMike, which of these do you see most often when you look at other artists' sites?",

  "SEGMENT_2_TITLE": "Building a Client-Converting Portfolio",
  "SEGMENT_2_SLIDES": "12, 14, 16",
  "SEGMENT_2_POINTS": [
    "High-quality images are essential but not sufficient alone",
    "Context matters: show healed tattoos, multiple angles, client stories",
    "Organize by style, not just chronologically",
    "Include variety: small pieces, large pieces, different skin tones, different body placements",
    "Each portfolio piece should tell a story and demonstrate your expertise"
  ],
  "SEGMENT_2_SCRIPT": "Now let's talk about your portfolio—the heart of your website. Everyone knows you need good photos, but there's so much more to it.\n\n[References Slide 12: The Perfect Portfolio Gallery]\n\nMike, your portfolio on your website is incredible. But it's not just beautiful photos—you've structured it in a way that makes it easy for potential clients to see themselves getting tattooed by you. How do you think about organizing your portfolio?\n\n[Mike discusses portfolio strategy]\n\nThis is brilliant. Notice what Mike is saying: it's not about showing every tattoo you've ever done. It's about showing the RIGHT tattoos that attract your IDEAL clients.\n\nHere's what your portfolio section needs:\n\n1. High-resolution images that load quickly (optimize them!)\n2. Multiple views: fresh AND healed tattoos when possible\n3. Categories by style so clients can find what they want\n4. Brief descriptions: size, placement, session time, any special story\n5. A mix that shows your versatility within your specialty\n\nThe goal is to make potential clients think: 'Yes, this artist can definitely do what I want.'",

  "SEGMENT_3_TITLE": "Mobile Optimization & Booking Conversion",
  "SEGMENT_3_SLIDES": "18, 20, 24",
  "SEGMENT_3_POINTS": [
    "Over 80% of tattoo clients research artists on their phones",
    "Mobile-first design is non-negotiable in 2026",
    "Simplify the booking process: fewer clicks = more conversions",
    "Clear CTAs: 'Book Consultation', 'Request Quote', 'View Availability'",
    "Reduce friction: pre-fill forms, accept deposits online, send automatic confirmations"
  ],
  "SEGMENT_3_SCRIPT": "Let's talk about the technical side that can make or break your website: mobile optimization and booking conversion.\n\n[Shows Slide 18: Mobile-First Design Principles]\n\nHere's a stat that should wake everyone up: more than 80% of people looking for a tattoo artist do their research on their phone. Not on a desktop computer—on their phone. If your website doesn't work perfectly on mobile, you're losing 8 out of 10 potential clients before they even contact you.\n\nMike, when you rebuilt your website, how much focus did you put on the mobile experience?\n\n[Mike discusses mobile strategy]\n\nPerfect. And this leads directly into conversion optimization. You can have the most beautiful website in the world, but if people can't easily book with you, what's the point?\n\n[Shows Slide 24: Booking Conversion Optimization]\n\nHere's your booking funnel:\n1. They land on your site (usually from Instagram or Google)\n2. They browse your portfolio (this is where most artists stop)\n3. They decide they want to work with you\n4. They try to book... and this is where it often falls apart\n\nYour website needs to make step 4 EASY. That means:\n- A visible 'Book Now' or 'Request Consultation' button on every page\n- A simple form (don't ask for their life story)\n- Clear next steps after they submit\n- Automated confirmation email\n- If possible, online deposit payment to secure the booking\n\nMike, how has streamlining your booking process impacted your business?",
